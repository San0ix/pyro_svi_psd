#+title: Code-Base for the Application of Pyro's Stochastic Variational Inference on Bayesian Spectral Density Estimation

* Prerequisites
To generate the underlying data, =R= is required, with the packages found in [[file:requirements_R.R]].
Simply run the script in =R= to install them.
#+begin_src sh
Rscript requirements_R.R
#+end_src

To run the stochastic variational inference in =Python=, ensure that all required packages are installed, e.g. using
#+begin_src sh
pip install -r requirements_python.txt
#+end_src

* Running the Inference Process
First, ensure that the required data is present, by running the =R= script [[file:generate_data.R]]
#+begin_src sh
Rscript generate_data.R
#+end_src

Then, run the python script =main.py=.
#+begin_src sh
python main.py
#+end_src
